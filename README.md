# Pihole Blocklist
<p>Ok, what is it? It's a list of domains/hosts which is will be used by private tv networks in order to handle their 'RedButton' smart tv functions. Yes they have a cookie policy and you can set "Do not track" - but I had to do this almost every day and my Samsung does not offer to disable/enable hbbtv per channel so I jsut created this simple/short list</p>
<p>I am using this list in pi-hole(https://pi-hole.net/) which is running on my Raspberry Pi One</p>

### How to use?
  Just add the following list to your pi-hole (group management -> Adlist).
